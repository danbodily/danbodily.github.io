                                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                                    <p style="text-align:left">Hello, I'm Dan. As you can see from the photo above, I have two little kids, Ben and Sage and we like to have fun together.  My wife Morgan and I live in Minneosta, but are transplants from Utah where we both finished our education.  She got a master's in teaching, while I studied robotics. My first encounter with her involved me recommending she introduce her students to code (I was harboring frustrations at the time about not first touching any code until I was 22).  In hindsight, I'd probably choose a different topic to kick things off with.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left">I've been a lot of different places pursuing education.  I grew up in Oregon, and made my first jump to Utah where I pursued a bachelor's in mechanical engineering. Along the way I spent a summer in Austin Texas studying isogeometric analysis with world-class experts in that field.  Looking for something a little more applied, I switched labs and, as apart of my master's work, had the fortunate experience of interning at <a href="https://www.otherlab.com">Otherlab</a> in San Francisco.  There I worked with a team in designing a pneumatic robotic arm to put on a NASA rover (see more here). My commute into SF was about two hours one way but the experience I had there was totally worth it. We were trying to do what no other engineering team had done before: build and accurately control a lightweight, totally inflatable robotic arm for deployment in a space exploration application. It really was an out-of-this-world experience (pun intended). <p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left">Fastforward four years and I now work as a R&D engineer at 3M in Minnesota doing what I love: fusing math into code to make robots (or any system for that matter) do super-human things. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, engaging in service with my church (I'm a member of <a href="https://lds.org">The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints</a>) and pursuing random new hobbies as they come.  Recently, I've spent a lot of time constructing crossword puzzles and hope to collaborate and engage more with the community on this front (check out a few of my crossword puzzles <a href="solveacrossword.html">here</a>). </p>
                                    <p style="text-align:left">In getting to this point, I've accumulated a lot of side projects I thought would be neat to share. My intent in creating this site was to create a space where readers with little-to no relevant background could be gently exposed to the inner-workings of some of the mystifying technologies of our day. I've also included code in a few of these projects that the more hands-on reader can reference. If you leave having gained just a bit more insight into how something works, then I've succeeded.</p>
